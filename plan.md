# EmbedDB — Investigation & Path Forward

## Completed Fixes

### Critical (causes data corruption) — **FIXED**
1. **In-place mutations break rollback** — `writeNode` overwrote B-tree pages in-place
   during transactions. Rollback restored root+allocator but the overwritten page data
   was permanently lost. Internal nodes retained dangling child pointers to freed pages,
   causing CRC corruption.
   → **Fixed with Option C (page snapshots):** `writeNode` snapshots old page bytes before
   overwriting. `rollback()` writes snapshots back to disk before restoring allocator.
   Torture test: 86K ops, 5,564 txns, 0 CRC errors.

### High (causes data loss) — **FIXED**
2. **BulkInsert replaces entire tree** — Built a new tree from only provided entries,
   setting `bt.rootOff` to the new root, orphaning ALL existing keys from other tables.
   → **Fixed:** `collectLeafEntries()` walks old tree, `mergeSortedEntries()` combines
   old + new, combined set builds the new tree. Also fixed `buildInternalNodes` panic
   when internal nodes have zero keys (single child) by adding `firstKeyInSubtree()`.

3. **InsertManyBulk bypasses transaction tracking** — Directly modified
   `entry.RecordCount` without checking `t.db.tx`.
   → **Fixed:** Added `t.db.tx` check, delegates to `tx.recordCounts` when active.

4. **bt.count = 0 unprotected in Rollback** — Ran after `bt.mu.Unlock()` in
   `SetRootOffset`. Concurrent reader could see stale count.
   → **Fixed:** Moved `bt.count = 0` inside `SetRootOffset` under `bt.mu.Lock()`.

### Medium — **FIXED**
5. **Missing bounds checks** — 7 call sites accessed `Children[i]` without `len(Children)` guard.
   → **Fixed:** Added bounds checks at all vulnerable call sites.

### Low — **RESOLVED**
6. **newTxnPages never used** — Removed when `pageSnapshots` replaced the old transaction mechanism.
7. **Transaction type not integrated** — Transactions fully re-enabled, exported as
   `DB.Begin()` → `Transaction.Commit()/Rollback()`. All 8 transaction tests active.

## Additional Changes (post initial investigation)

### Map support
- `map[string]V` fields stored/round-tripped as TLV-encoded key-value pairs
- All scalar value types supported (string, int/int8-64, uint/8-64, float32/64, bool)
- Non-string key types and unsupported value types rejected at `Use[T]()` time

### Type validation hardening
- `validateLayout` runs unconditionally on `Use[T]()` (was gated behind encryption)
- Rejects: `chan`, `func`, `uintptr`, `unsafe.Pointer`, `complex*`, `[N]T` arrays, `*T` pointers
- Rejects maps with non-string keys or unsupported value types
- `interface{}` fields allowed but silently skipped (backward compatible)

### Deadlock fix
- `database.go:ensureRegionLocked` wrapped `Resize()` in `WriteLock/WriteUnlock`,
  but `Resize()` internally acquires the same mutex — double-lock deadlock.
  Fixed by removing the outer `WriteLock/WriteUnlock`.

### Encryption flag fix
- `computeFieldOffsets` never parsed `db:"encrypt"` tag into `field.Encrypted`.
  Fixed by adding tag parsing and setting `Encrypted: true` on FieldOffset.

### Reflect-to-unsafe conversion
- `encodeMapField`: FieldByName + MapRange + .Int()/.String() → unsafe.Add + native for-range
- `encodeSliceOfStructs`: FieldByName + val.Index(i) → unsafe.Add + pointer arithmetic
- `GetMapField`: FieldByName + map[string]interface{} → unsafe.Add + typed map return
- `GetSliceOfStructs`: FieldByName chain → unsafe.Add + reflect.NewAt
- Map round-trip 3.2× faster (7,558 → 2,373 ns), 2.5× less memory

### CRC conversion (Castagnoli)
- B-tree pages use Castagnoli CRC (154 ns vs 303 ns, 2× faster)
- Backward compatible: `buf[1] = 0x01` flag distinguishes old IEEE from new Castagnoli
- Records, free list, WAL entries still use IEEE (not hot paths)

## Remaining Issues

### High priority
1. **B-tree pages never freed** — No `Free()` calls in production code. Orphaned
   pages from splits/merges/deletes/BulkInserts accumulate. File grows unbounded.
   Vacuum can reclaim some but can't detect all orphans.

### Medium priority
2. **Multi-table BulkInsert scan cost** — `collectLeafEntries()` walks all leaves
   of the shared B-tree to collect old entries. For large multi-table databases,
   this is O(total entries) per BulkInsert. Could be optimized with table-scoped
   B-trees or key prefix filtering during the collection walk.

3. **Dirty-cell encoding in serializeNode** — Re-serializes entire 4KB page every
   `writeNode` call even when only one cell changed. A dirty-bit system could patch
   just the modified cell region (~15% CPU savings from profiles).

### Low priority
4. **Pre-allocate TLV encode buffer** — `encodeFieldPayload` grows via `append`.
    Struct layout knows field count and sizes up front.

5. **Allocator double-allocation hardening** — Debug mode exists but is off in production.
    A production-mode check (e.g., bitmap or page-zero check) would catch corruption.

## Verdict

All critical/high severity bugs from the original investigation are fixed and verified.
The remaining item (page reclamation) is a medium-severity quality-of-life issue that
manifests as unbounded file growth on heavy delete/update workloads. Vacuum provides
a partial workaround but doesn't reclaim all orphaned pages.
